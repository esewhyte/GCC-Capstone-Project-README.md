This project provides a detailed analysis of customer purchasing behavior and revenue generation using Google sheets and Tableau

**Overview**
This dataset is designed for analyzing customer purchasing behavior, identifying revenue trends, and evaluating customer value. It includes information about transactions, customer demographics, and revenue data, enabling detailed insights into customer behavior and business performance.
Contents of the Dataset
The dataset contains the following fields:
****Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
****Order Date: Date of the transaction.
****Revenue: Total revenue generated from each transaction.
****Country: Location of the customer.
****Marital Status: Marital status of the customer.
****First Name and Last Name: Names of the customers.
****Other derived fields: Columns created during data preparation (e.g., Customer Name, Weekday, Month, Year, Age Band).

****PART A: Data Preparation
Dataset Statistics:
Number of Rows: 17,422
Minimum Revenue: £3.00
Maximum Revenue: £5,398.00
Average Revenue: £1,249.28
Total Revenue: £21,764,991.00

****PART B: Data Transformation
Transformations Performed:
Merged Columns:
Combined the First Name and Last Name columns into a single column called Customer Name.
Derived Columns:
Weekday: Extracted the day of the week from the Order Date.
Month: Extracted the month from the Order Date.
Year: Extracted the year from the Order Date.
Age Band: Categorized customers into age groups based on predefined categories.

****PART C: Data Aggregation
Revenue Analysis by Country and Marital Status:
Created a summary table showing the sum of revenue by country and marital status, similar to the example in Table 2. This provides an overview of how revenue varies across demographics.

****PART D: Data Visualization
Questions Addressed in the Tableau Dashboard:
Gender-Based Analysis:
What percentage of revenue is generated by customers of different genders?
Marital Status Comparison:
Compare the revenue generated by customers based on marital status.
Age Band Analysis:
Compare the revenue generated from customers across different age bands.
Customer Value Segmentation:
What is the revenue generated by customers based on customer value?
Revenue by Weekday:
Display the revenue generated on each weekday for all years.
Quarterly Weekday Revenue:
Display the revenue generated on each weekday for quarters in each year.
Highest Orders by Year:
Which year did the customers place the highest number of orders?
Highest Orders by Quarter:
Which quarter of each year had the highest number of orders?
Top and Bottom Customers:
Identify the first 5 customers with the highest revenue and the least 5 customers with the lowest revenue.
Country Revenue Analysis:
Which country generated the highest revenue?
How to Use the Dataset
Loading into Tableau:
Connect the dataset to Tableau for creating interactive dashboards and conducting in-depth analyses.
Use filters and calculated fields to derive insights.
Analysis Workflow:
Aggregate data to compute total revenue and customer-specific metrics.
Answer the listed questions through calculated fields, visualizations, and dashboards.
Assumptions and Limitations
Data Completeness:
Ensure no missing values in critical fields like Customer ID, Order Date, and Revenue.
Derived Columns:
Accuracy of derived fields like Age Band, Weekday, Month, and Year depends on the correctness of the Order Date field.
